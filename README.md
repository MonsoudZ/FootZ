## Timeframes

Tell us how long you anticipate spending on each area of development. Be sure to consider how many hours a day you plan to be coding and how many days you have available until presentation day.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle. You have limited time to code all phases of the game. Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Throughout your project, keep track of your Time Invested and Actual Time and update your README regularly.

^ Not sure what all to put in the details but I would assume with 4 days of work with a min of 12 hours days and a max of 17 hours a day on the project the max time I could hit would be 48-68 hours total time.

## Code Snippet

Use this section to include a brief code snippet of functionality that you are proud of and a brief description.

.wrapper .sidebar ul li:hover a {
color: #854;
}

I'm really happy about this. I kept diving deep into css to see how powerful it was and its very powerful. Messed up my project a little i bet so its not totally clean but I really enjoy the almost blended in sidebar and the orange bronze as you glade over it.

## Change Log

Use this section to document what changes were made and the reasoning behind those changes.

I ended up taking out a couple of menu items that was making the screen too busy.

I went back and forth on how to present the information so landed on a table format.

i took off the video as well as i like the idea but the way it wasn't sitting with me right.
